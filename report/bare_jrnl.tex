% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e

\usepackage{float}
%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} goal of this assignment was to implement and test some feature-based detection and tracking algorithms. In particular, the idea was to experiment as much as possible on a given video with different approaches, fine-tuning the parameters to enhance the (qualitative) performance in a particular real-case scenario.

\subsection{Analysis of the Video}
\label{subsec:video-analysis}
The footage proposed for the testing is very peculiar because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item objects have very similar characteristics (features);
    \item both the background and the foreground are particularly flat;
    \item all the objects in the scene behave similarly (i.e. are influenced only by the camera movement apart from small possible lens distortions);
    \item some components are characterised by glossy surfaces, introducing problems due to possible reflections;
    \item illumination is overall constant, aside from small LEDs.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{first_frame.png}
    \caption{One of the first frame of the video.}
    \label{fig:first_frame}
\end{figure}

\section{Proposed Methods}
From the preliminary analysis explained in \Cref{subsec:video-analysis}, it can be quickly understood why region-based techniques would easily fail (or at least would make both detection and tracking much more difficult). Indeed, the suggested approach to use feature-based techniques makes more sense.

To this end, the following methods were considered for feature detection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \text{Good Features to Track} (GFTT), which highlights those points that exhibits high gradient values on both the \(X\) and the \(Y\) direction. In particular, it considers textures and corners;
    \item \text{Scale Invariant Feature Transform} (SIFT), which - as the name suggests - finds those keypoints that are scale (and rotation) invariant (i.e. unaffected by scale) and the descriptors associated with them;
    \item \text{ORB} (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), that is a fusion of FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor with many modifications to enhance the performance, making it faster than SIFT while maintaining (almost) the same accuracy.
\end{itemize}

Starting from these detectors, the following algorithms were considered for tracking/matching:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow;
    \item Brute-Force Matcher;
    \item Kalman Filter.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, in order to investigates other methodologies a template-based approach was considered.

\section{Results}
In this section, a qualitative analysis of the results is presented for each approach that was considered, along with the possible variations that were put in place to reach better performance.

\subsection{Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow}
\label{subsec:lk}
Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow was the very first technique to be considered, mostly because we already had the opportunity to experiment with it during the lab sessions. In order to compute the matching, the algorithm requires both the frames at time $t-1$ and $t$, and the features detected at the previous iteration. Due to this, it is necessary to initialise the procedure using a feature detector; in particular, I have decided to run some experiments using GFTT, SIFT, and ORB.

Stating the difference between the three feature detectors is actually quite tricky because they all lead to a matching performed with almost flawless precision. However, it is possible to notice how SIFT manages to be more consistent with the features extracted across different objects, due to the fact that is unaffected by rotations and scaling.

Unfortunately, SIFT comes at a great cost in terms of computational requirements, and causes the video to slow down. A good trade-off can be reached by decreasing the number of features that are extracted by the detector. Of course, other parameters can be controlled to increase the overall performance, such as the number of layers for each octave, or the sigma value which is used for the Gaussian smoothing. At the end, when working with 30 features and an initial sigma level of 3, SIFT is still able to reach really good accuracy.

Instead, another approach consists of using ORB, which is faster and can flawlessly deal with thousands of features. However, speed comes at a slight less quality and, for this reason, it is possible to observe that some keypoints detected are not as good as the one found by SIFT: in fact, they are sometimes associated to borders and tend for the majority to overlap with each other.

Finally, I considered the GFTT algorithm and noticed very interesting results when tweaking the parameters correctly. In fact, with the default configuration that we have used for the lab some flat surfaces/lines are detected, leading to oscillations during the tracking. However, despite being a simpler algorithm (i.e. a corner detector), by specifying an higher quality and an higher minimum Euclidean distance, it was possible to detect very stable and uniformly distributed keypoints.

At the end, a final remark is related to the sampling rate. Indeed, Lucas-Kanade purpose is to track features across two consecutive frames (i.e. the optical flow assumption should hold). However, features can be occluded as time goes on; in particular, the camera focus in the proposed video shifts from right to left and so features start disappearing. To solve this issue, features need to be periodically detected and this means that some algorithms, such as SIFT, could become computationally very heavy. In this case, it is possible to have good performances by sampling every 50 frames (minimum 70).

\subsection{Brute-Force Matcher}
Given that descriptors associated to keypoints are required for the Matcher, I have decided to consider both SIFT and ORB detectors for such a task. In particular, I wanted to evaluate how much difference there is between the two in terms of computational power required. In fact, in this particular scenario it is necessary to retrieve the descriptors at every frame in order for the matching to be effective, which has an impact on the real-time performance. Moreover, to compare the Brute-Force Matcher performance w.r.t. Lucas-Kanade, I have decided to keep one of the set of descriptors fixed, updating it only every 50 frames.

As expected, SIFT has a very strong impact on real-time performance. In fact, as shown in \Cref{tab:detc_comp}, the time required for processing the video increases by 30 seconds. Of course, as anticipated in \Cref{subsec:lk}, the results obtained with SIFT are qualitatively better compared with ORB. 

\begin{table}[!t]
    \centering
    \caption{SIFT \& ORB comparison}
    \label{tab:detc_comp}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
        \toprule % <-- Toprule here
        \textbf{Detector} & \textbf{N. Features} & \textbf{Time (MM:SS)} & \textbf{CPU (\%)} \\
        \midrule % <-- Midrule here
        SIFT & 100 & 01:11 & 361 \\
        ORB & 100 & 00:41 & 343 \\ 
        \bottomrule % <-- Bottomrule here
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Overall, Brute-Force Matcher is very computationally demanding because descriptors need to be computed at every frame and the matching procedure is indeed a brute force approach. Moreover, results obtained are worse compared to Lucas-Kanade. In fact, previous keypoints are never discarded, and this means that the same descriptor could match a similar keypoint in a completely different location as shown in \Cref{fig:bruteforce}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{bruteforce_match_wrong_bhv.png}
    \caption{From Left to Right: the keypoints extracted previously; the matching keypoints in the current frame.}
    \label{fig:bruteforce}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Kalman Filter}
The third proposed technique is the Kalman Filter, i.e. a probabilistic approach to estimate the next position of a given entity - which is assumed to have certain properties at a given instant (i.e. location, speed, acceleration) - subject to some noise.

Of course, in this scenario multiple objects are present, which means that different matrices (i.e. measurement, transition, process noise, and measurement noise) should be used to track each of them. However, the objects in the scene behave all in the same way: in particular, they are all subject to the motion of the camera. For this reason, a single set of matrices can be used to estimate the motion of all the keypoints in the current system.

Unfortunately, a strong limitation of the system is the fact that the only observations that can be used in order to update the starting matrices are the ones provided by another tracking algorithm, namely from Lucas-Kanade. This means that, at the end, the system is already tracking the object that Kalman should track.

Nonetheless, the results are quite interesting and it is possible to see how (provided enough observation) the process stabilizes after some iterations, providing predictions that are very close to the observations as shown in \Cref{fig:kalman}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.32]{kalman_tracking.png}
    \caption{From Left to Right: Kalman at the first frame; Kalman after some frames}
    \label{fig:kalman}
\end{figure}

In order to reach such performance, several trials were performed to properly tweak the starting matrices. Moreover, when few observations (features) are available, Kalman is not able to perceive the scene as a whole and correctly predict the next point position. Such behaviour is probably due to the fact that Lucas-Kanade observations are very consistent and, after some frames, the keypoints are updated, meaning that they could jump abruptly from one position to another in a non-linear fashion.

\subsection{Multiple Template Matching}
Lastly, I decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective; in particular, I used a template-based matching procedure in order to detect some specific objects in the scene. Of course, I knew from the very beginning that this method was not the best possible approach, due to the fact that it is very scale, shape, and also color dependent.

Indeed, the first results were not convincing at all. For this reason, I decided to improve its accuracy by employing some very simple pre-processing techniques; in particular, I first tried to use inverse binarisation in order to focus on darker objects. However, illumination - mostly shadows - proved to be a problem, which was addressed by applying a simple Gaussian Blurring. Finally, I also tried the Canny edge-detector in order to focus more on corners.

Unfortunately, such simple techniques did not lead to astonishing improvements: in fact, the algorithm is still quite weak to illumination and scaling. Nonetheless, I was surprised about how, when simply considering the starting template, the procedure was able to correctly detect many objects.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% use appendices with more than one appendix
